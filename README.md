# Buckle App!

------------------------------

You're entering a novel use case of cross chain liquid staking protocol done with Chainlink ccip!

Users can bridge (and in the future swap) tokens without minting/burning tokens on source/destination chain.

_Buckle App...._

## Building in Public - Live Streaming Development

I'm live streaming on Youtube the development of Buckle App. Every day, I'll be live designing, coding, testing the project until it's complete.
Started from the design, I will implement smart contracts and frontend.

Please, follow me on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@fabriziogianni7) and [here you'll find the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOLuLBu_egI&list=PLRWSSe23vY_tiReJzSOfDxgljIrnf0Lkk) of the live streaming.

## What is Buckle App

**Buckle App** is a trustless cross chain bridge/swap protocol operating with Chainlink ccip. It's inspired by the model of [atomic swaps](https://chain.link/education-hub/atomic-swaps), but it's much more.

Buckle App has its **Cross Chain Pools Pairs** where LPs can deposit Tokens and earn fees and other users can transfer their tokens from network to network. We will replace the term "bridge" with "teleport".

Buckle App is like is a trustless, automated atomic swap protocol, based on pools. Therefore we will call it **Cross Chain Pool Swap Protocol**.

> Anyone can create new cross chain pool pairs, and he need to give initial funding.

> The terms "bridge" and "swap" are replaced by the term "teleport"

## Protocol Risks

| Risk            | Degree        | Motivation                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smart Contracts | Low           | When the protocol will be shipped, it will be well tested, audited and reviewed |
| Technology Risk | Low           | Based on CCIP which is decentralized                                            |
| Censorship Risk | Low           | Based on CCIP which is decentralized                                            |
| Custodial Risk  | None          | It's non custodial                                                              |
| Liquidity Risk  | Not Dangerous | If there's no liquidity, users can't bridge                                     |
